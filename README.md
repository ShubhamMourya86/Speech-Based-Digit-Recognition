# Speech-Based-Digit-Recognition

# Description
Developed a speech-based digit recognition system that utilizes speech recognition techniques to accurately identify spoken digits. The system leverages the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for effective speech recognition and prediction.

# Tools & Technologies:

Programming Language: C++   

Development Environment: Visual Studio

Audio Processing: Cool Edit

# Digit recognition system:
1. System  has training and testing modules.
2. Training module uses HMM to create models for the recorded digits.
3. Testing module should contain an interface for recording input speech signal. Input signal is tested against the stored models and get a match with the highest probability.
